Warpgate is a smart SSH bastion host for Linux that can be used with _any_ SSH client.

* Set it up in your DMZ, add user accounts and easily assign them to specific hosts within the network.
* Warpgate will record every session for you to replay and review later through a built-in admin web UI.
* Not a jump host - forwards your connections straight to the target instead.
* Single-file statically linked binary with no dependencies.
* Written in 100% safe Rust.
